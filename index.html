                <p>It was mid June 2020. Canada was in it’s third month of lockdown due to the Covid-19 pandemic. I was
                    a
                    student then and as a part of my class project, <span>
                        I redesigned the grocery shopping experience of Metro Inc
                    </span> which is the
                    third largest grocer
                    in Canada. I was particularly interested for the topic, as during the lockdown, I noticed a
                    significant
                    change in
                    the grocery shopping behaviour among my friends, family and specifically in myself. I shifted to
                    eating
                    at home,
                    limited the frequency of store visits, became more dependent on online purchase. So I was curious to
                    know the newly evolved grocery shopping experience.

                        <h4>Comprehensive Product Details</h4>
                        <p>Research indicated that inadequate product information cause poor user experience. I noticed,
                            metro mobile app currently does not contain necessary product details. So, I decided to
                            include
                            a comprehensive "Nutrition Facts" in the product details section. This will decrease the
                            volume
                            of returned products in the store which will be beneficial for business. Also, customers
                            will be
                            less required to visit the store for returning unwanted products. </p>

                        <div>
                            <p>Research indicated that, as per the existing mental model, users expect a search bar when
                                they land in the home page of an app.

                                During the usability test, it seemed a long-winded task for users just to find out that
                                there
                                is a “Shop online on
                                metro.ca” link which they needs to click to get access to the search bar</p>

                            <div>
                                <img src="styles/images/searchProblem.png" alt="">
                            </div>

                            <p>Also, the content of the app seemed scattered enough that users had difficulty in some
                                basic
                                product search related use cases such as product search by category/ sale.</p>

                            <p>To make the product browse experience more seemless, I decided to make following changes:
                            </p>
                            <div>

                <h3>Usability Test</h3>
                <p>I tested my prototype with two users and asked them to <span>search for products and see product
                        details</span>
                </p>

                <p> The search function went smooth during the test. But, then I realized there are still opportunity of
                    improvement. What
                    about those users who wants to check the aisle no. of a long list of grocery items during their
                    grocery
                    visit? Let's say
                    for 20 items, he has to search 20 times.Why not showing the information in one place?</p>

                    <h3>The Improvements</h3>
                    <p>Research indicated that users usually have a list before their grocery visits; either in text,
                        paper
                        or on mobile. In my design, I included a feature where users can make a list of grocery, and
                        view
                        the
                        stock availability in one place.</p>

                <p>It was the very first time for me working as a designer in a UX case study. I spent quite amount of
                    time
                    discussing and reviewing my research and design decisions with the amazing mentors of Juno College
                    of
                    technology who is working as UX industry experts. I learnt how to effectively convey my rationale
                    and
                    justify the design during the discussions back-and-forth, and it drove the entire project
                    towards a better direction. </p>
