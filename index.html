            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>It was mid June 2020. Canada was in it’s third month of lockdown due to the Covid-19 pandemic. I was a
                student then and as a part of my class project, I conducted a UX research on Metro Inc which is the
                third largest grocer
                in Canada. I was particularly interested for the topic, as during the lockdown, I noticed a significant
                change in
                the grocery shopping behaviour among my friends, family and specifically in myself. I shifted to eating
                at home,
                limited the frequency of store visits, became more dependent on online purchase. So I was curious to
                know the readiness of a top Canadian grocer to serve its online customer base.

                Due to the covid-19 pandemic lockdown situation,I took the interview
                using <span class="important">FaceTime and Facebook messenger</span>. I used the <span

                activity recorded their response using the <span class="important">

            </p>

            <h4>Contributors</h4>
            <p>I single-handedly conducted the research and took occassional guidance from the amazing mentors
                of "Juno College of Technology" to design my research.</p>

                        <p>
                            When a screen reader user adds an item in the cart, the focus skips the option to
                            increase(+) / decrease(-) the item. As
                            a result, they cannot immediately change the number of item chosen in the cart. The only
                            option available at this stage
                            is to remove the item from the cart. To increase/decrease the number of item, the user needs
                            to tab through the entire
                            page and come again to increase(+)/ decrease(-) button. Only then, the increase(+)/
                            decrease(-) receives the focus which
                            is inconvenient for the users.

                            The website does not use semantic element which will create difficulties for a screen reader
                            to navigate the site.
                            Example includes:
                            There is no

            </h2>


            <p>As a designer
                and a user, I would rate Metro's digital experience as 2 out of 5.</p>
            <div class="rating">

            <p>
                Few usability issues where I would like to bring immediate attention to are:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li> "Search for items" is one of the most common use cases that users perform in a grocery app. But, in
                    Metro app, it was the most difficult task to do and induced negative emotion.
                </li>
                <li>Online grocery shopping is new experience for many people. During the user research, I noticed users
                    feels anxious providing their credit card information in these platforms.
                    In this scenario, the error prevention issue that I found
                    during heuristics evaluation (creating user account without authenticating) would create trust
                    issues.</li>
